# somnia

somnia is a PE-based architecture. This project is not to recreate the whole scalable architecture itself(such as simba), rather, it is for you to get familiar with [nvdla](http://nvdla.org/). The design flow is from [beta phase of soDLA](https://github.com/soDLA-publishment/soDLA).

The whole NVDLA design flow is very complicated. So, in this project, I make a simplified flow for you to understand NVDLA better.
