[SIMBA](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ysshao/assets/papers/shao2019-micro.pdf) is a scalable DLA architecture. This project is not to recreate the whole architecture itself, rather, it is for you to get familiar with [nvdla](http://nvdla.org/). The design flow is from [beta phase of soDLA](https://github.com/soDLA-publishment/soDLA).

The whole NVDLA design flow is very complicated. So, in this project, I make a simplified flow for you to understand NVDLA better.
